# Slate - _Note it well._
_Slate is a static, browser based note-taking app made using `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript` and `jQuery`._<br><br>

### Features:
* Add/Delete/Alter a note.
* Each note can be given a priority level.
* Based on the priority level given to notes, they can be sorted by clicking on `Sort`.
* All the notes are stored as `JSON objects` locally on the users device. They automatically get retreived on re-launcing the application.
